How do we protect communities from wildfire? This question has a complex answer with many possible solutions. First and foremost, we need to redouble our efforts to reduce the number of wildfire ignitions. For example, the 2017 wildfire season showed that we need to start thinking about underground power lines in high-fire areas. We also need to ensure that our firefighters have all of the tools and emerging technologies they need to quickly detect wildfires as soon as they start, and to mobilize initial attack resources even more quickly than they already do.

In addition to the need for reducing wildfire ignitions, we have long advocated for smarter development practices:

- Avoiding building homes in fire-prone areas within the “wildland urban interface”
- Maintaining smart defensible space around structures
- Building or retrofitting homes using fire-safe materials

Development in the wildland urban interface is a growing side effect of urban sprawl in local cities. 
Too often, developments are approved in areas with significant fire risk. This puts considerable pressure on 
land managers to prevent fires from moving into these areas and threaten lives and property. 
Communities throughout California have long understood the need to avoid building in floodplains, and the same logic needs 
to be applied to building in areas at high risk for wildfire. Limiting the construction of homes and other buildings in 
areas of high fire risk can greatly mitigate wildfire damage in the future. Reducing development in fire-prone areas may 
also decrease the probability of human-caused ignitions there.

For homes and structures that already exist in areas at risk of being affected by wildfire, defensible space is a first step to better-protecting your home. Fire scientists recommend clearing vegetation no further than 100 feet from your buildings. Reducing woody vegetation immediately adjacent to structures by about 40% while also ensuring that other vegetation does not overhang or touch structures have been shown to be some of the best measures a homeowner in fire-prone areas can take.

During high-wind conditions, embers (also called “firebrands”) can be spread up to a mile or more, creating a dangerous situation where houses far away from the flames can ignite. Retrofitting existing homes or building new homes and structures with fire-safe materials can significantly reduce the risk of fire damage from firebrands. These steps include replacing roofing — one of the most vulnerable parts of your home — with non-wood materials such as fiberglass-asphalt shingles, metal sheets, clay tiles, or slate. Vents should also be covered with screens to inhibit ember entry into your home and they should be cleared of any vegetative debris on a regular basis. Other techniques include installing double-paned windows to reduce the heating of indoor materials from a fire outside and sealing all wall junctions and other potential points of entry for smoke and embers.

Going forward, our communities should rethink how — and whether — new development should be approved in the wildland urban interface. Homeowners already in fire-prone areas can take control of their home’s safety by replacing flammable wood shingles, installing double-pane windows, and installing innovative equipment designed to protect homes from fire such as rooftop sprinklers. All of these approaches have been shown to work time and again and they place the responsibility of protecting our communities on us collectively rather than placing the blame of wildfire destruction on our unique ecosystems.
